# 👋 Hello! I'm Sijo
### 🎮 Frontend Lead by day, Manga enthusiast by night
Currently leading the frontend squad at Diagnal Technologies, where I wrestle with React and make video players behave across every screen imaginable! When I'm not debugging CSS or optimizing render cycles, you'll probably find me deep in the latest manga chapter or planning my next trek (though let's be honest, lately it's been more about that WFH life 🏠).

## 🚀 What I'm up to
- 🎥 Building cool OTT stuff at Diagnal Technologies
- 📱 Making video players work smoothly (or at least trying to!)
- 🦦 Getting cozy with Go
- 🏃‍♂️ Attempting to balance code life with actual running
- 📺 Always down to chat about that new anime season

## 💻 Tech I vibe with
```javascript
const Sijo = {
  frontend: ['React', 'JavaScript', 'CSS Wizardry'],
  current_obsession: 'Making those micro-interactions juuust right',
  past_adventures: ['Healthcare apps', 'Food delivery', '5G/4G solutions'],
  learning: 'Go (because apparently JavaScript wasn't enough of a challenge)',
  workouts: ['Running', 'Trekking', 'Debug marathons'],
   certifications: [
    'Certified Scrum Master (CSM) - Scrum Alliance',
    'Certified Secure Web Application Engineer (C)SWAE certification - Mile2',
    "Go: The Complete Developer's Guide (Golang) by Stephen Grider"
    "Understanding TypeScript by  Maximilian Schwarzmüller in 2022",
  ]
};
```

## 🎯 Fun facts
- Professional pixel-pusher with a love for clean animations
- Can debate about manga storylines as passionately as code architecture
- Will definitely overengineer a solution if you let me
- Surprisingly good at explaining tech stuff (or so my team tells me)
